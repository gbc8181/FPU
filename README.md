# FPU
The codes are used for implementing The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) problem in linear and nonlinear mode.

# Required softwares
Matlab 2016a+

# How to run this code
For linear, please let beta = 0 and alpha any number between 0 and 1.
For nonlinear, please let beta any number between 0 and 1.

# result
For linear mode, a purely linear law for the springs guarantees that energy given to a single 'normal' mode always remains in that mode. For nonlinear mode, the energy equipartition state was not reached and energy was periodically returning to the initially excited mode.
